Chronic Disease Prevalence Analysis (2010–2016)


📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes chronic disease prevalence across the United States, focusing on Diabetes, Tobacco Use, and Obesity between 2010 and 2016. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning and analysis, and Tableau for visualization, the project highlights national and state-level health trends.
The goal is to demonstrate skills in data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and data visualization while uncovering insights into public health patterns.


🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (data cleaning, analysis, and initial visualization)
Tableau Public: Interactive dashboards and maps
Jupyter Notebook: Development environment for Python analysis
📂 Project Workflow
Data Cleaning (Python)
Handled missing values and filtered relevant topics (Diabetes, Tobacco, Obesity).
Removed redundant “United States” totals for state-level analysis.
Exploratory Analysis (Python)
Top 5 states with highest prevalence of Diabetes, Tobacco use, and Obesity.
Trends over time (2010–2016) for all three topics.
Created line plots and bar charts to visualize patterns.
Data Visualization (Tableau)
Line chart: Prevalence trends for Diabetes, Tobacco, and Obesity.
Bar charts: Top states by prevalence.
Map visualization: Geographic distribution across U.S. states.


📈 Key Insights
Diabetes prevalence remained consistently higher than Tobacco and Obesity during this period.
Southern states showed the highest rates of Obesity and Tobacco use.
Public health trends indicate that lifestyle factors remain major contributors to chronic disease prevalence in the U.S.
